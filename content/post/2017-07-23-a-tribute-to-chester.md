## A Tribute to Chester

These days I heard a shocking news, that the vocal of Linkin Park, Chester Bennington committed suicide.  

Linkin Park is one of my favorite band when I was in high school. And I even remember the first time that I heard their song on the radio, it is a song called somewhere I belong. I love it and I tried to find all the songs of this band. It seems like all these things just happened in yesterday.

I thought Chester is the one who makes his dreams come true. Because he creates a lot of great songs with their band and performs all around the world. There are so many people love their songs, and he uses his power of influence helps a lot of people. I thought his life was glory and meaningful.  

But I am wrong. Until I heard the news that he suicided, I realized how much he was suffering all the time.  

I admire him. Even though he was going through all the painful things, he turns his pain into music, which comforts a lot of people and gives them the courage and strength to go on.

So, I think, when I feel sad, could I try to turn it to another thing? Could I change all the sadness into a song? a drawing? an article? So I could use them as a tribute to Chester, to those creators I love.  

I thought when I grow up, I will have a lot of chances to see the live shows of Chester, but now I never have this opportunity anymore.   

Life is so short. But it still has so many things we could do, and there are so many people here that we care about. Do the things you wanna do from now.   
Chester, wish you go to the world you love. May you rest in peace.
